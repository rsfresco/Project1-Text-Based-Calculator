/*
 * This is a basic Calculator Text based project 
 * 
 * Developer: 	Raymart S. Fresco
 * Date:		04/29/2017
 * Time:		4:30 AM ~ 5:50 AM
 * Expected Duration:	1hr
 * Result Duration:		-20min
 * Work-Type:	Review/Practice
 * Details:	The algorithm of this project is based on an imitation of an actual calculator
 * 			where as values are asked for calculation and arithmetic operators as follow.
 * 			It's easy for me to ask the user to input two values then calculate it, however,
 * 			the challenge of this program is to make a realistic calculator that is text based
 * 			and has real-time feel as if using a real calculator.
 * 
 * Note:	This is a basic operation of program and will have some improvement
 * 			later on after a few other projects.
